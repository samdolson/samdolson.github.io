Currently, I am only a co-author on the following paper: 

[GREGORY: A Modified Generalized Regression Estimator Approach to Estimating Forest Attributes in the Interior Western US](https://doi.org/10.3389/ffgc.2021.763414)

But I did also help make a (now neglected) R package: [gregRy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gregRy/gregRy.pdf)

Since then I've been working on a number of projects while at Iowa State University.
